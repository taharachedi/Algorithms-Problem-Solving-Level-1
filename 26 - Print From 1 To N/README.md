# 🔺Problem 26: Number Counter Program

> **Display numbers from 1 to N using different looping constructs** with this simple C++ program.

## 🧩 Project Overview
This program prompts the user to enter a number \( N \) and displays all numbers from 1 to \( N \) using three different looping methods: **for**, **while**, and **do-while**. It's a great exercise for understanding loop structures in C++!

---

## 🌟 Features
- **📥 User Input:** Guides the user to enter a number \( N \).
- **🔁 Multiple Looping Techniques:** Demonstrates the use of `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops to count up to \( N \).
- **🖨️ Clear Output:** Displays the counted numbers in a straightforward manner.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Input Number**: The program prompts the user to input the last number \( N \).
2. **Counting Methods**:
   - **For Loop**: Counts from 1 to \( N \) using a `for` loop.
   - **While Loop**: Counts from 1 to \( N \) using a `while` loop.
   - **Do-While Loop**: Counts from 1 to \( N \) using a `do-while` loop.
3. **Display Results**: Each method's output is printed clearly.

## 🛠️ Code Breakdown
### 🔹 Main Functions
- **`ReadNumber()`**
  - Prompts the user to input the last number \( N \) and returns the value.
- **`Counter_For(short N)`**
  - Uses a `for` loop to display numbers from 1 to \( N \).
- **`Counter_While(short N)`**
  - Uses a `while` loop to display numbers from 1 to \( N \).
- **`Counter_DoWhile(short N)`**
  - Uses a `do-while` loop to display numbers from 1 to \( N \).
