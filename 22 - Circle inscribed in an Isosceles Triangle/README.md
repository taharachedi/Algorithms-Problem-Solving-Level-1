# 🔺 Problem 22 :Circle Area Inscribed in an Isosceles Triangle 

✨ This C++ program calculates the area of a circle inscribed within an isosceles triangle. The program requires the user to input the side length (`a`) and the base (`b`) of the triangle.

## 🛠️ Features
- 🔢 **User Input**: Prompts the user to enter the side length and base of the triangle.
- 📐 **Area Calculation**: Computes the area of the inscribed circle using a formula derived for an isosceles triangle.
- 🖨️ **Output**: Displays the calculated area of the inscribed circle.

## 📚 How It Works
1. 👤 **User Input**: The user is prompted to input the side length (`a`) and the base (`b`) of the isosceles triangle.
2. 📏 **Area Calculation**: Using a specific formula, the program calculates the area of the circle inscribed within the triangle.
3. 🖨️ **Result Display**: The calculated area is printed to the screen.

## 🔧 Functions Used
- 📥 **`Read(float& a, float& b)`**: Prompts the user to input the side length `a` and base `b` of the triangle.
- 🧮 **`CalculArea(float a, float b)`**: Calculates the area of the circle inscribed within the triangle. 
- 🖨️ **`Print(float Area)`**: Outputs the calculated area to the console.

## 🚀 Getting Started

## ▶️ Execution Example
📅 The program will prompt the user to enter the triangle's side and base, then display the inscribed circle's area.

🎯 Example input:

```plaintext
Please Enter The Triangle Side a : 6
Please Enter The Triangle Base b : 4

The Circle Area Inscribed In An Isosceles Triangle is : 6.28
