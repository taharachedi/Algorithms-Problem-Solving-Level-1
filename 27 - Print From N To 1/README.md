# 🔺Problem 27: Countdown Program

> **Display numbers from N to 1 using different looping constructs** with this simple C++ program.

## 🧩 Project Overview
This program prompts the user to enter a number \( N \) and counts down from \( N \) to 1 using three different looping methods: **for**, **while**, and **do-while**. It's a practical example for understanding loop structures in C++!

---

## 🌟 Features
- **📥 User Input:** Guides the user to enter a number \( N \).
- **🔁 Multiple Looping Techniques:** Demonstrates the use of `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops to count down from \( N \) to 1.
- **🖨️ Clear Output:** Displays the countdown in a straightforward manner.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Input Number**: The program prompts the user to input the number \( N \).
2. **Counting Methods**:
   - **For Loop**: Counts down from \( N \) to 1 using a `for` loop.
   - **While Loop**: Counts down from \( N \) to 1 using a `while` loop.
   - **Do-While Loop**: Counts down from \( N \) to 1 using a `do-while` loop.
3. **Display Results**: Each method's output is printed clearly.

## 🛠️ Code Breakdown
### 🔹 Main Functions
- **`Read()`**
  - Prompts the user to input the number \( N \) and returns the value.
- **`Counter_For(short N)`**
  - Uses a `for` loop to display numbers from \( N \) to 1.
- **`Counter_While(short N)`**
  - Uses a `while` loop to display numbers from \( N \) to 1.
- **`Counter_DoWhile(short N)`**
  - Uses a `do-while` loop to display numbers from \( N \) to 1.
